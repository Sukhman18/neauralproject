The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread impact globally, and healthcare professionals have been continuously striving to find effective ways to detect and treat the virus. One promising method involves the use of artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques to analyze medical images such as X-rays and CT scans. This presentation focuses on the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze radiography images for identifying COVID-19 cases.

About the Algorithm Used:
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is an artificial neural network designed to analyze visual data such as images and videos. It is a deep learning model that is specifically useful for image classification and recognition.
The CNN model comprises multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layers apply filters to the input image to extract various features from it, while the pooling layers downsize the feature maps using max or average pooling. Finally, the fully connected layers use the output of the previous layers to make a prediction about the input image's class.
When training the model, the weights of the filters and fully connected layers are adjusted to minimize a loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual label. This process is accomplished by using an optimization algorithm like stochastic gradient descent.
